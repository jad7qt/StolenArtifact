Stolen Artifact is a top-down stealth game where you play as a cunning thief named Zahir, who, after becoming unsatisfied with his life of poverty, has turned to art theft in order to steal his way to the lavish life of his dreams. Sneak past the security guards, laser beams, and cameras protecting each exhibit, make use of a variety of special items, and escape with the precious artifacts before the museum opens.

### How to Play
- Use WASD or arrow keys to move
- Start a level by entering its corresponding door at the thief's apartment
- X and C to use items
- Avoid the guards and their flashlights
- Collect the artifact by walking near it, and escape back through the door at the beginning of the level
- Escape before time runs out

### Content Available
- Level select scene styled as thief's apartment
- Two levels: The Holy Grail and the Mona Lisa
- Each level is timed, to encourage speedrunning
- Two items available in Mona Lisa level: the rock and the invisibility cloak
  - The rock can be thrown with C and distracts guards
  - The invisibility cloak can be used with X and lasts for 10 seconds, making the player undetectable by guards
 
### Lessons Learned
We learned a significant amount about the game design process as a whole, especially how to work as a team and implement features such as a player movement, collision detection, tilemaps, menu screens, and dynamic enemy behavior. We also had to deal with asynchronous functions in scripts and learned how difficult it can be to create features that don't have unintentional side effects/unexpected behaviors.
